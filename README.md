# Introduction
This is a test project that I made to practice and better understand Vue 3. I haven't seen a thorough table component for Vue 3 this may fill in that gap for future uses. It may go open source with it after it matures enough for public usage.

## Installation
---
Install the package

```
npm install --save vue-my-table-3
```

Import and use in your entry file (main.js).

```
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import VueMyTable3 from 'vue-my-table-3'
createApp(App)app.use(VueMyTable3)app.mount('#app')
```

Then you can use it in your Vue components as:

```
<vue-table></vue-table>

```
