# Introduction
This is a test project that I made to practice and better understand Vue 3. I haven't seen a thorough table component for Vue 3 this may fill in that gap for future uses. It may go open source with it after it matures enough for public usage.

README will be updated with examples and documentation as more functions are developed.
